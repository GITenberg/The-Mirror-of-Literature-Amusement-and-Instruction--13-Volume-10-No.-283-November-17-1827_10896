<p>The locomotive facility with which the aid of our graphic
department enables us to <i>transport</i> our readers, (for we have
already sent them to <i>Sydney</i>,) is somewhat singular, not to
say ludicrous; and would baffle the wand of Trismegistus, or the
cap of Fortunatus himself. Thus, during the last six weeks we have
journeyed from the <i>Palace at Stockholm</i> (No. 277) to that of
<i>Buckingham, in St. James's Park</i>, (278;) thence to
<i>Brambletye</i>, in the wilds of <i>Sussex</i>, (279;) to
<i>Hamlet's Garden at Elsineur</i>, (280;) then to the deserts of
<i>Africa</i>, and <i>Canterbury</i>, (281;) in our last, (282,) we
introduced our readers to the palatial splendour of the <i>Regent's
Park;</i> and our present visit is to <i>Haddon Hall</i>, in
<i>Derbyshire</i>, one of the palaces of olden time, whose
stupendous towers present a strong contrast with the puny
palace-building of later days, and the picturesque beauty of whose
domain pleasingly alternates with the verdant pride of the Regent's
Park.</p>
<p>Haddon is situate about one mile south-east of Bakewell, and is
one of the most curious and perfect of the old castellated mansions
of this country. It stands on a gentle hill, in the midst of thick
woods overhanging the Wye, which winds along the valley at a great
depth beneath. The house consists of two courts; in the centre
building behind which is the great hall, with its butteries and
cellars. Over the door of the great porch, leading to the hall, are
two coats of arms cut in stone; the one is those of Vernon, the
other of Fulco de Pembridge, lord of Tong, in Shropshire, whose
daughter and heir married Sir Richard Vernon, and brought him a
great estate. In one corner of the hall is a staircase, formed of
large blocks of stone, leading to the gallery, about 110 feet in
length and 17 in width, the floor of which is said to have been
laid with boards cut out of one oak, which grew in the park. In
different windows are the arms of England in the garter, surmounted
with a crown; and those of Rutland impaling Vernon with its
quarterings in the garter; and these of Shrewsbury. In the east
window of the Chanel adjoining were portraits of many of the Vernon
family, but a few years ago the heads were stolen from them. A date
of <i>Mi esimo</i> ccccxxvii. is legible. In the north window the
name <i>Edwardus Vernon</i> and his arms remain; <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page330" name="page330"></a>[pg 330]</span> and in
a south window is <i>Willmus Trussel</i>. In the chapel also stands
a Roman altar, dug up near Bakewell.</p>
<p>All the rooms (except the gallery) were hung with loose arras, a
great part of which still remains; and the doors were concealed
every where behind the hangings, so that the tapestry was to be
lifted up to pass in or out. The doors being thus concealed, are of
ill-fashioned workmanship; and wooden bolts, rude bars, &amp;c. are
their only fastenings. Indeed, most of the rooms are dark and
uncomfortable; yet this place was for ages the seat of magnificence
and hospitality. It was at length quitted by its owners, the Dukes
of Rutland, for the more splendid castle of Belvoir, in
Lincolnshire.</p>
<p>For many generations Haddon was the seat of the Vernons, of whom
Sir George, the last heir male, who lived in the time of queen
Elizabeth, gained the title of king of the Peak, by his generosity
and noble manner of living. His second daughter and heir married
John Manners, second son of the first Earl of Rutland, which title
descended to their posterity in 1641. For upwards of one hundred
years after the marriage, this was the principal residence of the
family; and so lately as the time of the first Duke of Rutland, (so
created by queen Anne,) <i>seven score</i> servants were
maintained, and during twelve days after Christmas, the house was
"kept open."</p>
<p>A few years before the death of Mrs. Radcliffe, the writer of
"The Mysteries of Udolpho," and several other romances, a tourist,
in noticing Haddon Hall, (and probably supposing that Mrs. R. had
killed heroes enough in her time,) asserted that it was there that
Mrs. R. acquired her taste for castle and romance, and proceeded to
lament that she had, for many years, fallen into a state of
insanity, and was under confinement in Derbyshire. Nor was the
above traveller unsupported in her statement, and some sympathizing
poet apostrophized Mrs. R. in an "Ode to Terror." But the fair
romance-writer smiled at their pity, and had good sense enough to
refrain from writing in the newspapers that she was not insane. The
whole was a fiction, (no new trick for a fireside tourist,) for
Mrs. Radcliffe had never <i>seen</i> Haddon Hall.</p>
<p>In the "Bijou" for 1828, an elegant <i>annual</i>, on the plan
of the German pocket-books, (to which we are indebted for the
present engraving,) are a few stanzas to Haddon Hall, which merit a
place in a future number of the MIRROR.</p>

<h3>POETICAL LOVE-LETTER.</h3>
<h4><i>(For the Mirror.)</i></h4>
<p>The sweeper of New Haven College, in New England, lately
becoming a widower, conceived a violent passion for the relict of
his deceased Cambridge brother, which he expressed in the following
strain:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">Before the news</p>

<a name="EARLY_RISING." id="EARLY_RISING."></a>
<h2>EARLY RISING.</h2>
<h4><i>(For the Mirror.)</i></h4>
<blockquote>"Whose morning, like the spirit of a youth,<br />
That means to be of note, begins betimes."
<p>SHAKSPEARE'S <i>Ant. and Cleop.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is asserted by a tragic poet, "est nemo miser nisi
comparatus;" which, by substituting one single word, is exactly
applicable to our present subject; "est nemo serus nisi
comparatus." All early rising is relative; what is early to one, is
late to another, and vice vers&acirc;. "The hours of the day and
night," says Steele, (Spec. No. 454.) "are taken up in the Cities
of London and Westminster, by people as different from each other
as those who are born in different countries. Men of six o'clock
give way to those of nine, they of nine to the generation of
twelve; and they of twelve disappear, and make room for the
fashionable world, who have made two o'clock the noon of the day."
Now since, of these people, they who rise at six pique themselves
on their early rising, in reference to those who rise at nine; and
they, in their turn, on theirs, in reference to those who rise at
twelve; since, like Homer's generations, they "successive rise,"
and early rising is, therefore, as I said, a phrase only
intelligible by comparison, we must (as theologians and politicians
ought oftener to do) set out by a definition of terms. What is
early rising? Is it to rise</p>
<blockquote>"What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,<br />
Can neither call it perfect day nor night?"</blockquote>
<p>"Patience!" I think I hear some of my fair readers exclaim, "Is
this the early rising this new correspondent of the MIRROR means to
enforce? Drag us from our beds at peep of day! The visionary
barbarian! Why, ferocious as our Innovator is, he would just as
soon drag a tigress from her's! We will not obey this
self-appointed Dictator!" Stay, gentle ladies; in the first place I
am not going to enforce this or any other hour; in the second
place, I am not going to enforce early rising at
all.&mdash;Convinced you feel, with me, the importance of time, and
your responsibility for its right improvement, I leave it to your
consciences whether any part of it should be uselessly squandered
in your beds. The moral culpability of late rising is when it
interferes with the necessary duties of the day; and though, my
fair readers, you may in a great measure claim exemption from
these, I would still, simply in reference to your health and
complexions, advise you not to exceed seven o'clock. But, to effect
this, a sine qu&acirc; non is, retiring early, say at
eleven&mdash;(though really I am too liberal.&mdash;When people
were compelled to retire at the sound of the curfew, when</p>
<blockquote>"The curfew toll'd the parting knell of
day,"</blockquote>
<p>early rising was a necessary consequence, as they were earlier
tired of their beds; and this may account for the singular
difference between ancient and modern times in this respect; so
that late rising, though a modern refinement, is by no means
exclusively attributable to modern luxury and indolence, but partly
to a change of political enactments, (you see, ladies, I am giving
you every chance.)</p>
<p>In the man of business, late rising is perfectly detestable; but
to him, instead of the arguments of health and moral responsibility
for time, (or rather in addition to these arguments,) I would urge
the argumentum ad crumenam; which is so pithily, however homelily,
expressed in these two proverbs, which he cannot be reminded of
once too often:</p>
<blockquote>"Early to bed, and early to rise,<br />
Will make a man healthy, wealthy, and wise."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"There are no gains without pains;<br />
Then plough deep, while sluggards sleep."</blockquote>
<p>And a third proverb is a compendium of my advice to both classes
of readers:</p>
<blockquote>"He who will thrive must rise at five;<br />
He who has thriven may sleep till seven."</blockquote>
<p>So then we have defined what early rising is; seven, to those
who have nothing to do,&mdash;as soon as ever business calls, to
those who have. Was ever bed of sloth more eloquently reprobated
than in the following lines from the <i>Seasons</i>?</p>
<blockquote>"Falsely luxurious will not man awake,<br />
And, springing from the bed of sloth, enjoy<br />
The cool, the fragrant, and the silent hour,<br />
To meditation due and sacred song?<br />
For is there aught in sleep can charm the wise?<br />
To lie in dead oblivion, losing half<br />
The fleeting moments of too short a life,<br />
Total extinction of th' enlighten'd soul!<br />
Or else, to feverish vanity alive,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page332" name="page332"></a>[pg
332]</span> Wilder'd and tossing through distemper'd dreams?<br />
Who would in such a gloomy state remain<br />
Longer than nature craves, when every Muse<br />
And every blooming pleasure wait without,<br />
To bless the wildly devious morning walk?"</blockquote>
<p>Exquisite indeed! But this too is a proof how nearly the sublime
and ridiculous are associated,&mdash;"how thin partitions do their
bounds divide;" for this fine poetry is associated, in most
reader's minds, with Thomson's own odd indulgence in the "dead
oblivion." He was a late riser, sleeping often till noon; and when
once reproached for his sluggishness, observed, that "he felt so
comfortable he really saw no motive for rising." As if, according
to the popular version of the story, "I am convinced, in theory, of
the advantage of early rising. Who knows it not, but what can Cato
do?" "Ay, he's a good divine, you say, who follows his own
teaching; don't talk to us of early rising after this." Why not,
unless like Thomson, you're kept up till a very late hour by
business? The fact is he did not</p>
<blockquote>&mdash;"In that gloomy state remain<br />
Longer than nature craves,"</blockquote>
<p>after all. He had a strong apology for not rising early, in the
late hours of his lying down. The deep silence of the night was the
time he commonly chose for study; and he would often be heard
walking in his library, at Richmond, till near morning, humming
over what he was to write out and correct the next day, and so,
good reader, this is no argument against my position; but observe,
retiring late is no excuse for late rising, unless business have
detained you: balls and suppers are no apology for habitual late
rising. And now, my dearest readers, do you spend the night
precisely as Thomson did, and I'll grant you my "letters patent,
license, and protection," to sleep till noon every day of your
life. You have only to apply to me for it through "our
well-beloved" editor of the MIRROR.</p>

<h2>BUNHILL FIELDS BURYING-GROUND.</h2>
<p>This extensive burial-place is part of the manor of Finsbury, or
<i>Fensbury</i>, which is of great antiquity, as appears by its
being a prebend of St. Paul's Cathedral in 1104. In the year 1315,
it was granted by Robert de Baldock to the mayor and commonalty of
London. Part of it was, in 1498, converted into a large field for
the use of archers and other military citizens to exercise in. This
is now called <i>The Artillery Ground</i>.</p>
<p>In the year 1665, that part of the ground now called
<i>Bunhill</i> (originally <i>Bonhill</i>) <i>Field</i>, was set
apart as a common cemetery, for the interment of such bodies as
could not have room in their parochial burial-grounds in that
dreadful year of pestilence. However, not being made use of on that
occasion, a Mr. Tindal took a lease thereof, and converted it into
a burial-place for the use of Dissenters. It was long called
<i>Tindal's Burial-place</i>. Over the west gate of it was the
following inscription:&mdash;"This church-yard was inclosed with a
brick wall at the sole charges of the city of London, in the
mayoralty of Sir John Lawrence, Knt., Anno Domini 1665; and
afterwards the gates thereof were built and finished in the
mayoralty of Sir Thomas Bloudworth, Knt., Anno Domini, 1666."</p>
<p>The fen or moor (in this neighbourhood), from whence the name
Moorfields, reached from London-wall to Hoxton; the southern part
of it, denominated <i>Windmill Hill</i>, began to be raised by
above one-thousand cart-loads of human bones, brought from St.
Paul's charnel-house in 1549, which being soon after covered with
street dirt from the city, the ground became so elevated, that
three windmills were erected on it; and the ground on the south
side being also much raised, it obtained the name of <i>The Upper
Moorfield</i>.</p>
<p>The first monumental inscription in Bunhill-fields is, <i>Grace,
daughter of T. Cloudesly, of Leeds. Feb. 1666.&mdash;Maitland's
Hist. of London</i>, p. 775.</p>
<p>Dr. Goodwin was buried there in 1679; Dr. Owen in 1683; and John
Bunyan in 1688.</p>

<h2>SUPPOSED ORIGIN OF MEZZO-TINTO.<a id="footnotetag1" name=
"footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></h2>
<p>Mezzo-tinto is said to have been first invented by Prince
Rupert, about the year 1649: going out early one morning, during
his retirement at Brussels, he observed the sentinel, at some
distance from his post, very busy doing something to his piece. The
prince asked the soldier what he was about? He replied, the dew had
fallen in the night, had made his fusil rusty, and that he was
scraping and cleaning it. The prince, looking at it, was struck
with something like a figure eaten into the barrel, with
innumerable little holes, closed together, like friezed work on
gold or silver, part of which the fellow had scraped away. The
<i>genie second en</i> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page333" name=
"page333"></a>[pg 333]</span> <i>experiences</i> (says Lord
Orford), from so trifling an accident, conceived mezzo-tinto. The
prince concluded, that some contrivance might be found to cover a
brass plate with such a ground of fine pressed holes, which would
undoubtedly give an impression all black, and that, by scraping
away proper parts, the smooth superfices would leave the rest of
the paper white. Communicating his idea to Wallerant Vaillant, a
painter, they made several experiments, and at last invented a
steel roller with projecting points, or teeth, like a file, which
effectually produced the black ground; and which, being scraped
away or diminished at pleasure, left the gradations of light. Such
was the invention of mezzo-tinto, according to Lord Orford, Mr.
Evelyn, and Mr. Vertue.</p>

<h2>RETROSPECTIVE GLEANINGS.</h2>
<hr />
<p>[For the following succinct account of the Gunpowder Conspiracy,
our acknowledgments are due to the proprietors of an elegant and
interesting <i>Annual</i>, entitled "THE AMULET" for 1828.]</p>
<h3>A BRIEF HISTORY OF "THE GUNPOWDER PLOT."</h3>
<h4><i>(Compiled from original and unpublished documents.)</i></h4>
<p>Of all the plots and conspiracies that ever entered into the
mind of man, the Gunpowder plot stands pre-eminent in horror and
wickedness.</p>
<p>The singular perseverance of the conspirators is shown by the
fact, that so early as in Lent of the year 1603, Robert Catesby,
who appears to have been the prime mover of the plot, in a
conversation with Thomas Wintour and John Wright, first broke with
them about a design for delivering England from her bondage, and to
replant the Catholic religion. Wintour expressed himself doubtful
whether so grand a scheme could be accomplished, when Catesby
informed him that he had projected a plan for that purpose, which
was no less than to blow up the Parliament House with
gunpowder.</p>
<p>Wintour consented to join in the scheme, and, at the suggestion
of Catesby, went over to Flanders to arrange some preliminary
affairs there, and to communicate the design to Mr. Fawkes, who was
personally known to Catesby. At Ostend, Wintour was introduced to
Mr. Fawkes by Sir Wm. Stanley. Guy Fawkes was a man of desperate
character. In his person he was tall and athletic, his countenance
was manly, and the determined expression of his features was not a
little heightened by a profusion of brown hair, and an
auburn-coloured beard. He was descended from a respectable family
in Yorkshire, and having soon squandered the property he inherited
at the decease of his father, his restless spirit associated itself
with the discontented and factious of his age. Wintour and Fawkes
came over to England together, and shortly after met Catesby,
Thomas Percy, and John Wright, in a house behind St. Clement's;
where, in a chamber with no other person present, each administered
an oath of secresy to the other, and then went into another room to
hear mass, and to receive the sacrament. Percy was then sent to
hire a house fit for their purpose, and found one belonging to Mr.
Whinniard, Yeoman to the King's Wardrobe of the Beds, then in the
occupation of one Henry Ferrers; of which, after some negociation,
he succeeded in obtaining possession, at the rent of twelve pounds
per annum, and the key was delivered to Guy Fawkes, who acted as
Mr. Percy's man, and assumed the name of John Johnson. Their object
in hiring this house was to obtain an easy communication with the
upper Parliament House, and by digging through the wall that
separated them, to form an extensive mine under the foundations. A
house was also hired in Lambeth, to serve as a depository for the
powder, and Mr. Keys, who was then admitted as one of the number,
was placed in charge. The whole party then dispersed, and agreed to
meet again at Michaelmas. At Michaelmas it was resolved that the
time was arrived when they should commence working at their mine;
but various causes hindered them from beginning, till within a
fortnight of Christmas. The party, at that time, consisting of
five, then entered upon their work; and, having first provided
themselves with baked meat that they might not have occasion to
leave the house, they worked incessantly till Christmas Eve,
underpropping the walls, as they proceeded, with wood. A little
before Christmas, Christopher Wright was added to the number; and,
finding their work to be extremely laborious, the walls being
upwards of three yards in thickness, they afterwards admitted
Robert Wintour to assist them. Taking advantage of the long and
dreary nights between Christmas and Candlemas, they then brought
their powder over from Lambeth in a boat and lodged it in Percy's
house, and afterwards continued to labour at the mine. In the
Easter following (1605) as they were at their work, the whole party
were dreadfully alarmed on hearing a rushing noise near them; but
on inquiry they found no danger menaced <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page334" name="page334"></a>[pg 334]</span> them,
but that it proceeded from the removal of some coals in an
adjoining vault, under the Parliament House. Nothing could be more
propitious for the conspirators; and, ascertaining that it belonged
to the same parties of whom they held the house, but in the
possession of a man of the name of Skinner, they lost no time in
purchasing the good-will of Skinner, and eventually hired the vault
of Whinniard, at the rate of four pounds per annum. Abandoning
their original intention of forming a mine under the walls, they
placed the powder in this vault, and afterwards gradually conveyed
into it three thousand billets of wood, and five hundred fagots;
Guy Fawkes arranging them in order, making the place clean and
neat, in order that if any strangers, by accident or otherwise,
entered the house, no suspicion might be excited. Fawkes then went
into Flanders to inform Sir W. Stanley and Mr. Owen of their
progress, and returned in the following August. Catesby, meeting
Percy at Bath, proposed that himself should have authority to call
in whom he pleased, as at that time they were but few in number,
and were very short of money. This being acceded to, he imparted
the design to Sir Everard Digby, Francis Tresam, Ambrose Rookewood,
and John Grant. Digby promised to subscribe one thousand five
hundred pounds, and Tresam two thousand pounds. Percy engaged to
procure all he could of the Duke of Northumberland's rents, which
would amount to about four thousand pounds, and to furnish ten good
horses.</p>
<p>Thus far, every thing had prospered with the conspirators;
success had followed every effort they had made.</p>
<p>On Thursday evening, the 24th of October, eleven days before the
intended meeting of Parliament, an anonymous letter was put into
the hands of the servant of Lord Monteagle, warning his Lordship
not to attend the Parliament that season, for that God and man had
concurred to punish the wickedness of the times. It is a most
extraordinary fact, that the conspirators knew of the delivery of
this letter to the Lord Monteagle, and that it was in the
possession of the Earl of Salisbury, Secretary of State, for eight
days before the disclosure took place, as developed in Thomas
Wintour's confession, taken before the Lord's Commissioners on the
23rd of November, 1605; yet so strong was their infatuation, and so
desperately had they set their fortunes on the event, that they
unanimously resolved "to abyde the uttermost tryall."</p>
<p>The generally received opinion has been, that it was to the
sagacity and penetration of King James that the detection of the
conspiracy must be ascribed, and that it was his Majesty who first
suggested the agency of gunpowder: but the Earl of Salisbury, in a
letter to Sir Charles Cornwallis, ambassador at Madrid, asserts,
that in a conversation between the Earl of Suffolk (Lord
Chamberlain) and himself, on perusal of the anonymous letter, the
employment of gunpowder first occurred to them, and that the King
subsequently concurred in <i>their</i> opinion. The letter, after
having been communicated to several of the Privy Council, was shewn
to the King three or four days before the opening of Parliament,
who, with great prudence, gave orders that no notice whatever
should be taken of it, but that every thing should go on as usual,
until the very day appointed. On Saturday, the Lord Chamberlain,
according to the customary forms of his office previous to the
meeting of every Parliament, viewed every room and cellar belonging
to the Parliament House, and amongst others the identical vault in
which the wood and powder was deposited, and observed a man, who
subsequently proved to be Guy Fawkes, standing there to answer any
questions that might have been asked. The Lord Chamberlain then
went to the Privy Council and reported what he had seen. After much
discussion it was resolved that a more minute search should be
made, under pretence of seeking for stolen goods, in order that no
suspicion might arise if nothing should be discovered. Accordingly,
on Monday at midnight, Sir T. Knyvett, accompanied by a small band
of men, went to Percy's house, where, at the door, they found Guy
Fawkes with his clothes and boots on. Sir Thomas immediately
apprehended him, and then proceeded to search the house and vault,
and upon removing some of the wood, they soon discovered the powder
ready prepared for the explosion; then, directly afterwards,
searching Guy Fawkes, they found on him three matches and other
instruments for setting fire to the train. He confessed himself
guilty, and boldly declared, that if he had happened to have been
within the house when Sir T. Knyvett apprehended him, he would
instantly have blown him up, house and all.</p>
<p>On the arrest of Guy Fawkes, such of the conspirators as at the
time were in London, fled into the country to meet Catesby at
Dunchurch, according to previous arrangement; and after taking some
horses out of a stable at Warwick, they reached Robert Wintour's
house, at Huddington, on the Wednesday night. On Thursday morning
the whole party, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page335" name=
"page335"></a>[pg 335]</span> amounting to about twenty persons,
confessed themselves to Hammond, a priest, received absolution from
him, and partook of the sacrament together, and then, with their
followers and servants, proceeded to Lord Windsor's house, at
Hewell, from whence they took a great quantity of armour and
weapons. They then passed into Staffordshire, and by night reached
the house of Stephen Littleton, called Holbeach house, about two
miles from Stourbridge. By this time the whole country was raised
in pursuit of the rebels; and a large party, under the direction of
Sir Richard Walshe, high sheriff of Worcestershire, early on Friday
morning arrived at Holbeach house. The party in the
house&mdash;consisting of Catesby, Percy, Sir E. Digby, Robert,
John, and Thomas Wintour, Grant Rookewood, the two Wrights, Stephen
Littleton, and their servants,&mdash;finding their condition now to
be desperate, determined to fight resolutely to the last, treating
the summons to surrender with contempt, and defying their pursuers.
A singular accident, however, put an end to all conference between
the parties. Some gunpowder, which the conspirators had provided
for their defence, proving damp, they had placed nearly two pounds
in a pan near the fire to dry; and a person incautiously raking
together the fading embers, a spark flew into the pan, ignited the
powder, which blew up with a great explosion, shattered the house,
and severely maimed Catesby, Rookewood, and Grant; but the most
remarkable circumstance was, that about sixteen pounds of powder,
in a linen bag, which was actually under the pan wherein the powder
exploded, was blown through the roof of the house, and fell into
the court-yard amongst the assailants, without igniting, or even
bursting.</p>
<p>Sir R. Walshe then gave orders for a general assault to be made
upon the house; and, in the attack that followed, Thomas Wintour,
going into the court-yard, was the first who was wounded, having
received a shot in the shoulder, which disabled him; the next was
Mr. Wright, and after him the younger Wright, who were both killed;
Rookewood was then wounded. Catesby, now seeing all was lost, and
their condition totally hopeless, exclaimed to Thomas Wintour,
"Tom, we will die together." Wintour could only answer by pointing
to his disabled arm, that hung useless by his side, and as they
were speaking, Catesby and Percy were struck dead at the same
instant, and the rest then surrendered themselves into the hands of
the sheriff.</p>
<p>At the end of January, 1606, the whole of the conspirators, at
that time in custody, being eight in number, were brought to their
trial in Westminster Hall, and were all tried upon one indictment,
except Sir E. Digby, who had a separate trial. On Thursday, January
30th, Sir E. Digby, Robert Wintour, John Grant, and Thomas Bates,
were executed at the west end of St. Paul's Church, and on the next
day Thomas Wintour, Ambrose Rookewood, Robert Keys, and Guy Fawkes,
suffered within the Old Palace-yard at Westminster.</p>
<p>On the 28th of February, 1606, Garnet was brought to trial at
Guildhall, before nine Commissioners specially appointed for that
purpose. Of his participation in the plot there was no doubt; and
he admitted himself criminal in not revealing it, although, as he
asserts, it was imparted to him only in confession: but it is more
than probable that the valuable papers, lately rescued from
oblivion, and preserved in his Majesty's State Paper Office, will
be able to prove his extensive connexion with the plot, his
knowledge of it, both <i>in</i> and <i>out</i> of confession, and
his influential character with all the conspirators.</p>
<p>Garnet was hanged on the 3rd of May, 1606, on a scaffold,
erected for that purpose, at the west end of St. Paul's Church.
Held up to infamy by one party as a rebel and a traitor, and
venerated as a saint and a martyr by the other; the same party
spirit, and the same conflicting opinions, have descended from
generation to generation, down to the controversialists of the
present day.</p>
<p>We subjoin the Autographs of some of the principal conspirators,
from the same source as the preceding narrative, as an appropriate
and equally authentic accompaniment:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Robert Catesbye</i>.&mdash;Taken from an original letter from
Catesbye to his cousin, John Grant, entreating him to provide money
against a certain time. This autograph is very rare.</p>
<p><i>Guido Fawkes</i>.&mdash;Taken from his declaration made in
the Tower on the 19th of November, and afterwards acknowledged
before the Lord's Commissioners.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Percy</i>.&mdash;From an original letter to W.
Wycliff, Esq. of York, dated at Gainsborough, November 2nd,
1605.</p>
<p><i>Henry Garnet</i>.&mdash;From one of his examinations, wherein
he confessed to have been in pilgrimage to St. Winifred's Well.</p>
<p><i>Ambrose Rookewood</i>.&mdash;From an original letter,
declared that he had felt a scruple of conscience, the fact seeming
"too bluddy."</p>
<p><i>Thomas Wintour</i>.&mdash;From an original <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page336" name="page336"></a>[pg 336]</span>
examination before the Lord's Commissioners, on the 25th of
November, 1605.</p>
<p><i>Francis Tresam.</i>&mdash;From his examination relative to
the book on Equivocation. Tresam escaped being hanged by dying in
the Tower, on the 23rd of December, 1605.</p>
<p><i>Sir Everard Digby</i>.&mdash;From an original examination. He
was related to John Digby, subsequently created Baron Digby and
Earl of Bristol, and was a young man of considerable talent. He was
in the twenty-fourth year of his age when executed.</p>
<p><i>To the Right Hon. the Lord Mounteagle</i>.&mdash;The
superscription to the anonymous letter that led to the discovery of
the plot. By whom it was written still remains a mystery.</p>
<p>All the principal conspirators were married and had families;
several of them possessed considerable property, and were highly,
and, in some instances, nobly related.</p>

<h3>THE AUBERGE.</h3>
<h4><i>(For the Mirror.)</i></h4>
<p>"Tais-toi, Louise," exclaimed the landlady of a small but neat
auberge at ------ to her daughter, a sweet child, about seven years
of age, who, playing with a little curly French dog, was sitting on
a three-legged stool, humming a trifling <i>chanson</i> which she
had gleaned from a collection of ditties pertaining to an old
woman, who, when the landlady might be busily engaged, attended the
infant steps and movements of Louise. "Tais-toi, ecoutez, la
diligence s'approche;" the truth of the good woman's remark being
vouched for by the heavy rumbling of that ponderous machine, the
"Vite, vite" of the postilion, and the "crack, crack" of his huge
whip. This was shortly after the battle of Waterloo, when our
troops, crowned with laurels, were hastily leaving the continent,
burning with anxiety to revisit <i>their native soil</i>, and their
countrymen of the peace department were as hastily leaving it,
fired with curiosity to behold the spot where such laurels had been
so hardly earned. At least such was undoubtedly the most prevalent
cause of the great influx of continental visiters at that period;
but there were, by way of contrast to these votaries of curiosity,
too many whose contracted brow and thoughtful melancholy cast of
visage betrayed forcibly their owners' curiosity to be otherwise
and more feelingly worked upon; 'twas the anxiety, the wish to
gather information respecting relatives or friends, killed or
wounded in the late dire struggle, which had caused those
appearances. But to my subject. 'Twas at the close of a very hot
July day that the diligence drew up to the door of the
before-mentioned auberge. "A diner," as the postilion (nearly
smothered in his tremendous "bottes fortes," genteelly taking from
his head a hat almost as small as the boots were in comparison
large) was politely pleased to term it. No pressing invitation was
requisite to incline our English travellers to take their seats
around the table well arranged with French fare, and fatigue seemed
to lose itself in the exhilaration proceeding from the chablis,
champagne, and chambertin; but there was <i>one traveller,</i>
whose melancholy defied eradication&mdash;<i>an English lady,</i>
genteelly but plainly habited, to appearance about seven and twenty
years of age; her features handsome and strongly marked; when in
health of mind and body, they might have possessed the "besoin du
souci," habitual to the country in which she was then travelling,
but were now too deeply clouded with that "apparence de la
mis&egrave;re," to which the English seem alone to give fullness of
effect&mdash;a fault, perhaps, but a sentimental one, worthy of
that or any other country. She had with her a beautiful boy, whose
age might be about five, who, attracted partly by the pretty
appearance of the dog, by signs and childish frolics, soon formed
acquaintance with the hostess's daughter, the little Louise. For
some time previous to the arrival of the diligence at the auberge,
a storm had been expected; and the distant thunder and heavy drops
of rain beating against the casements before the dinner was half
over, gave appearance of justice and reason to the entertainment of
such anticipations, and caused a general congratulation at the
party being so safely housed. As the storm was increasing every
minute, much argument was not necessary to induce the postilion to
delay proceeding until it might abate. Some of the party adhered to
the bottle, some resorted to a book, and some to cards, to wile
away the time. The lady requested to be conducted to a private
apartment, wherein to pass with her dear child (remote from the
noisy mirth of her companions, so little according with her then
feelings) the time, until the diligence might again be ready to
start. But half an hour had scarce elapsed from the formation of
this arrangement ere admission was sought and gained by a brigade
of English soldiers, six of whom, on a support formed by muskets,
bore what seemed to be the corpse of an officer, whose arm, hanging
down, gave to another officer the hand. Such a scene soon attracted
general attention. In a few minutes a couch, by the junction of two
or three chairs, was made, and on that the body laid. The soldiers
who had formed the support, with arms grounded and grief deeply
marked on their countenances, presented a melancholy group; whilst
the young officer, kneeling by the couch, and gazing intently on
his friend, but served to heighten the melancholy of the scene. A
long silence of anxiety, interrupted but by the rolling of the
thunder and the pattering of the rain, ensued. "'Tis no use," at
length exclaimed the friend of the wounded man, "'tis now no use
even to hope, my brave fellows; the surgeon was deceived, and rash
to consent to his removal. Your commander has sunk beneath the
fatigue. I thought it would be so. Peace," he exclaimed, as the
tears fell fast from his eyes, "peace to thy manes, brave,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page338" name="page338"></a>[pg
338]</span> generous St. Clair." An agonizing shriek from above
startled all; and in another moment the lady (the traveller in the
diligence) fell on what appeared to be the soldier's bier.
"Heavens! what dream is this?" exclaimed the officer who had been
so assiduous in his attention to the unfortunate man; "my sister
here!&mdash;let me intreat, let me beg&mdash;" "No, Albert
Fitzalleyn&mdash;no, brother, no," uttered Mrs. St. Clair, "remove
me not&mdash;I am calm, resigned, very, very calm&mdash;I expected
this&mdash;if I cannot live I can die with him. St. Clair,
awake&mdash;your wife, your Charlotte calls&mdash;what not one
smile?&mdash;look here," she cried, pulling the frightened,
trembling, weeping child towards the body, "your child, your boy,
your dearest Edward calls for you too. O, agony! he does not move.
Dead! no, no, it cannot be&mdash;my life, my love, my husband." And
there was something, it did seem, in that sweet voice which reached
the dying warrior's heart, for he opened those eyes already partly
glazed with the film of death, and if in them expression remained,
it beamed on his afflicted wife. Reason and strength too returned,
but their dominion was momentary, for with one hand feebly grasping
that of his wife, his other resting on the head of his dear boy,
and his sunken eyes directed from the one to the other, the brave,
the respected, the beloved St. Clair died! He sank on the rough,
uncouth couch, and with him the senseless form of his fond wife.
The stillness of the corpse scarcely surpassed that which for a
time was reigning over the group assembled there; at length the
brother gently raised the wretched widow from her sad
resting-place; but the fair sufferer was released from all earthly
pain; with her husband she could not live, but she indeed with him
had died! Their son, Edward St. Clair, is in existence, living
with, and beloved by, his uncle, Albert Fitzalleyn,</p>

<hr />
<h3>ROMEO COATES.</h3>
<p>What was Kemble, Cooke, Kean, or Young, to the celebrated
Diamond Coates, who, about twenty years since, shared with little
Betty the admiration of the town? Never shall I forget his
representation of Lothario at the Haymarket Theatre, for his own
pleasure, as he accurately termed it; and certainly the then rising
fame of Liston was greatly endangered by his Barbadoes rival. Never
had Garrick or Kemble, in their best times, so largely excited the
public attention and curiosity. The very remotest nooks of the
galleries were filled by fashion, while in a stage-box sat the
performer's notorious friend, the Baron Ferdinand Geramb.</p>
<p>Coates's lean Quixotic form, being duly clothed in velvets and
in silks, and his bonnet richly fraught with diamonds, (whence his
appellation,) his entrance on the stage was greeted by such a
general crowing, (in allusion to the large cocks, which as his
crest adorned his harness,) that the angry and affronted Lothario
drew his sword upon the audience, and actually challenged the rude
and boisterous inhabitants of the galleries, <i>seriatim</i>, or
<i>en masse</i>, to combat on the stage. Solemn silence, as the
consequence of mock fear, immediately succeeded. The great actor,
after the overture had ceased, amused himself for some time with
the baron, ere he condescended to indulge the wishes of an
anxiously expectant audience. At length he commenced; his appeals
to his heart were made by an application of the left hand so
disproportionably lower than the "seat of life" has been supposed
to be placed; his contracted pronunciation of the word "breach,"
and other new readings and actings, kept the house in a right
joyous humour, until the climax of all mirth was attained by the
dying scene of "the gallant and the gay;" but who shall describe
the prolonged agonies of the dark seducer! his platted hair
escaping from the comb that held it, and the dark crineous cordage
that flapped upon his shoulders in the convulsions of his dying
moments, and the cries of the people for medical aid to accomplish
his eternal exit. Then, when in his last throes his bonnet fell, it
was miraculous to see the defunct arise, and after he had spread a
nice handkerchief on the stage, and there deposited his head-dress,
free from impurity, philosophically resume his dead condition; but
it was not yet over, for the exigent audience, not content "that
when the man were dead, why there an end," insisted on a repetition
of the awful scene, which the highly flattered corpse executed
three several times to the gratification of the cruel and
torment-loving assembly.</p>
<p>Coates, too, was destined to participate somewhat in the
celebrated f&ecirc;te in honour of the Bourbons in 1811. Having no
opportunity of learning in the West Indies the propriety of being
presented at court, ere he could be upon a more intimate footing
with the prince, he was less astonished than delighted at the
reception of an invitation on that occasion to Carlton house.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page339" name="page339"></a>[pg
339]</span> What was the fame acquired by his cockleshell curricle,
(by the way, the very neatest thing seen in London before or
since;) his scenic reputation; all the applause attending the
perfection of histrionic art; the flatteries of Billy Finch, (a
sort of kidnapper of juvenile actors and actresses, of the O. P.
and P. S. in Russell-court;) the sanction of a Petersham; the
intimacy of a Barrymore; even the polite endurance of a Skeffington
to this! To be classed with the proud, the noble, and the great. It
seemed a natural query, whether the Bourbon's name were not a
pretext for his own introduction to royalty, under circumstances of
unprecedented splendour and magnificence. It must have been so.
What cogitations respecting dress, and air, and port, and bearing!
What torturing of the confounded lanky locks, to make them but
revolve ever so little! then the rich cut velvet&mdash;the diamond
buttons&mdash;ay, every one was composed of brilliants! The night
arrived: ushered by well-rigged watchmen to clear the way, the
honoured sedan bore its precious burthen to the palace, and the
glittering load was deposited in the royal vestibule itself. Alas!
what confusion, horror, and dismay were there, when the ticket was
pronounced a forgery! All that the considerate politeness of a
Bloomfield or a Turner might effect was done to alleviate the fatal
disappointment. The case was even reported instanter to the prince
himself; but etiquette was amongst the other "restrictions" imposed
upon his royal highness; and, however tempered by compliment and
excuse, "the diamonds blaze" reached not farther than the hall, and
were destined to waste their splendour, for the remainder of the
night, in the limited apartments of Craven-street.</p>

<h3>CALAIS</h3>
<p>Calais will merit to be described by every Englishman who visits
it, and to be read of by every one who does not&mdash;so long as
Hogarth, and "Oh! the Roast Beef of Old England!" shall be
remembered, and&mdash;which will be longer still&mdash;till the
French and English become one people, merely by dint of living,
within three hours' journey of each other. Calais has been treated
much too cavalierly by the flocks of English, who owe to it their
first, and consequently most fixed impressions of French manners,
and the English want of them. Calais is, in fact, one of the most
agreeable and characteristic little towns in France. It is "lively,
audible, and full of vent"&mdash;as gay as a fair, and as busy as a
bee-hive&mdash;and its form and construction as compact.</p>
<p>Calais, unlike any English town you could name, is content to
remain where it is&mdash;instead of perpetually trying to stretch
away towards Paris, as our's do towards London, and as London
itself does towards them. Transporting you at <span class=

to the "Place" in the centre of the town (an entirely open square,
of about 150 paces by 100,) you can scarcely look upon a more
lively and stirring scene. The houses and their shops (they have
all shops) are like nothing so much as so many scenes in a
pantomime&mdash;so fancifully and variously are they filled, so
brightly and fantastically painted, and so abruptly do they seem to
have risen out of the ground! This last appearance is caused by the
absence of a foot-path, and of areas, porticoes, railings,
&amp;c.&mdash;such as, in all cases, give a kind of <i>finish</i>
to the look of our houses. The houses here seem all to have grown
up <i>out</i> of the ground&mdash;not to have been built
<i>upon</i> it. This is what gives to them their most striking
effect of novelty at the first view. Their brilliant and various
colourings&mdash;so unlike our sombre brick-work&mdash;is the next
cause of the novel impression they produce. The general strangeness
of the effect is completed by the excellence of the pavement, which
is of stones, shaped like those of our best London carriage-ways,
but as white as marble in all weathers, and as regular as the
brick-work of a house-front. The uniformity of the "Place" is
broken (not very agreeably) by the principal public edifice of
Calais&mdash;the Town Hall; a half-modern, half-antique building,
which occupies about a third of the south side, and is surmounted
at one end by a light spiring belfry, containing a most loquacious
ring of bells, which take up a somewhat unreasonable proportion of
every quarter of an hour in announcing its arrival; and, in
addition, every three hours they play "<i>Le petit chaperon
rouge</i>" for a longer period than (I should imagine) even French
patience and leisure can afford to listen to it. Immediately behind
the centre of this side of the "Place" also rises the lofty tower,
which serves as a light-house to the coast and harbour, and which
at night displays its well-known revolving lights. Most of the
principal streets run out of this great Square. The most busy of
them&mdash;because the greatest thoroughfare&mdash;is a short and
narrow one leading to the Port&mdash;(<i>Rue du Havre</i>:) in it
live all those shopkeepers who especially address themselves to the
wants of the traveller. But the gayest and most agreeable street is
one running from the north-east corner of the "Place" (<i>Rue
Royale</i>.) It terminates in the gate leading to the suburbs
(<i>Basse Ville</i>,) and to the Netherlands and the interior of
the country. In this street is situated the great hotel
Dessin&mdash;rendered famous for the "for ever" of a century or so
to come, by <i>Sterne's Sentimental Journey</i>. The only other
street devoted exclusively to shops is one running parallel with
the south side of the "Place." The rest of the interior of Calais
consists of about twenty other streets, each containing here and
there a shop, but chiefly occupied by the residences of persons
directly or indirectly connected with the trade of Calais as a
sea-port town.</p>
<p>If you believe its maligners, Calais is no better than a sort of
Alsatia to England, a kind of extension of the rules of the King's
Bench. The same persons would persuade you that America is
something between a morass and a desert, and that its inhabitants
are a cross between swindlers and barbarians; merely because its
laws do not take upon them to punish those who have not offended
against them! If America were to send home to their respective
countries, in irons, all who arrive on her shores under suspicion
of not being endowed with a Utopian degree of honesty&mdash;or, if
(still better) she were to hang them outright, she would be looked
upon as the most pious, moral, and refined nation under the sun,
and her climate would rival that of Paradise. And if Calais did not
happen to be so situated, that it affords a pleasant refuge to some
of those who have the wit to prefer free limbs and fresh air to a
prison, it would be all that is agreeable and genteel. It seems to
be thought, that a certain ci-devant leader of fashion has chosen
Calais as his place of voluntary exile, out of a spirit of
contradiction. But the truth is, he had the good sense to see that
he might "go farther and fare worse;" and that, at any rate, he
would thus secure himself from the intrusions of that "good
company," which had been his bane. By-the-by, his last "good thing"
appertains to his residence here. Some one asked him how he could
think of residing in "such a place as Calais?" "I suppose," said
he, "it is possible for a gentleman to <i>live</i> between London
and Paris."</p>
<p>The interior of Calais I need not describe further, except to
say that round three-fourths of it are elevated ramparts,
overlooking the surrounding country to a great extent, and in
several parts planted with trees, which afford most pleasant and
refreshing walks, after pacing the somewhat perplexing pavements of
the streets, and being dazzled by the brilliant whiteness which
reflects from that, and from the houses. The port, which occupies
the other fourth, and is gained by three streets parallel to each
other, and leading from the "Place," is small, but in excellent
order, and always alive with shipping, and the amusing operations
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page341" name="page341"></a>[pg
341]</span> appertaining thereto; and the pier is a most striking
object, especially at high water, when it runs out, in a straight
line, for near three quarters of a mile, into the open sea. It is
true our English engineers&mdash;who ruin hundreds of their fellow
citizens by spending millions upon a bridge that nobody will take
the trouble to pass over, and cutting tunnels under rivers, only to
let the water into them when they have got all the money they can
by the job&mdash;would treat this pier with infinite contempt as a
thing that merely answers all the purposes for which it was
erected! as if <i>that</i> were a merit of any but the very lowest
degree. "Look at Waterloo Bridge!" they say; "we flatter ourselves
<i>that</i> was not a thing built (like the pier of Calais) merely
for use. Nobody will say that any such thing was wanted! But, what
a noble monument of British art, and what a fine commemoration of
the greatest of modern victories!" True: but it would have been all
this if you had built it on Salisbury Plain; and in that case it
would have cost only half the money. The pier of Calais is, in
fact, every thing that it need be, and what perhaps no other pier
is; and yet it is nothing more than a piece of serviceable
carpentery, that must have cost about as much, perhaps, as to print
the prospectuses of some of the late undertakings, and pay the
advertisements and the lawyer's bill.</p>

<h3>CURIOSITY.</h3>
<p>If I were to enumerate all the great and venerable personages
who indulge in an extensive curiosity, I should never arrive at the
end of my subject. Lawyers and physicians are eternal questionists;
the clergy are curious, especially on agricultural affairs; the
first nobles in the land take in the "John Bull" and the "Age" to
gratify the most prurient curiosity. The gentlemen of the Stock
Exchange live only from one story to another, and are miserable if
a "great man's butler looks grave," without their knowing why. So
general indeed is this passion, that one half of every Englishman's
time is spent in inquiring after the health of his acquaintance,
and the rest in asking "what news?" There is a very respectable
knot of persons who go up and down the country asking people their
opinion of the pope's infallibility, and what they think of the
Virgin Mary; and when they do not get an answer to their mind, they
fall to shouting, "The Church is in danger," like a parcel of
lunatics. Another set, equally respectable, are chiefly solicitous
for your notions concerning the Apocalypse; and to learn whether
you read your Bible at all, or whether with or without note or
comment. Then again, a third set of the curious are to be seen,
mounted upon lamp-posts, and peeping into their neighbours'
windows, to learn whether they shave themselves, or employ a barber
on a Sunday morning; and a fourth, who cannot find time to go to
church, in their anxiety to know that their neighbours do not smoke
pipes and drink ale in the time of divine service. In short,
society may be considered as one great system of espionage; and the
business of every man is not only with the actions, but with the
very thoughts of all his neighbours.</p>

<h2>THE SELECTOR.<br />
AND<br />
LITERARY NOTICES OF <i>NEW WORKS</i>.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>CHRONICLES OF THE CANONGATE.</h3>
<p>[<i>Ecce iterum Crispinus!</i>&mdash;We intend to continue our
notice of the above work in a series of snatches, or portraitures,
for which mode (from its varied and detached character) it is
perhaps better calculated than any of its predecessors. Our
anticipatory anxiety in selecting the <i>Two Drovers</i> was a
forcible illustration of the maxim, <i>Qui dat cito, dat bis;</i>
for the extent occupied by the portion already quoted and its
interruption, with the immense influx of works recently published,
have somewhat interfered with our arrangements. In "the
Introduction" to the "Chronicles," Sir Walter Scott avows the
authorship of the Waverley Novels, and recapitulates the
explanation which took place at the Theatrical Fund Meeting, at
Edinburgh, in July last. Sir Walter then proceeds to acknowledge,
with gratitude, "hints of subjects and legends" which he received
from various quarters, and occasionally used as a foundation of his
fictitious compositions, or wove in the shape of episodes; and from
these acknowledgments we select the following <i>dram.
pers.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Old Mortality.</i>&mdash;It was Mr. Train, supervisor of
excise at Dumfries, who recalled to my recollection the history of
Old Mortality, although I myself had a personal interview with that
celebrated wanderer, so far back as about 1792. He was then engaged
in repairing the grave-stones of the Covenanters who had died while
imprisoned in the castle of Dunnottar, to which many of them were
committed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page342" name=
"page342"></a>[pg 342]</span> prisoners at the period of Argyle's
rising; their place of confinement is still called the Whig's
vault. Mr. Train, however, procured for me far more extensive
information concerning this singular person, whose name was
Patterson, than I had been able to acquire during my short
conversation with him. He was (as I may have somewhere already
stated) a native of the parish of Closeburn, in Dumfries-shire, and
it is believed that domestic affliction, as well as devotional
feeling, induced him to commence the wandering mode of life, which
he pursued for a very long period. It is more than twenty years
since Robert Patterson's death, which took place on the high road
near Lockerby, where he was found exhausted and expiring. The white
pony, the companion of his pilgrimage, was standing by the side of
its dying master; the whole furnishing a scene not unfitted for the
pencil. These particulars I had from Mr. Train.</p>
<p><i>Jennie Deans</i>.&mdash;An unknown correspondent (a lady)
favoured me with the history of the upright and high principled
female, whom, in the "Heart of Mid Lothian," I have termed Jeanie
Deans. The circumstance of her refusing to save her sister's life
by an act of perjury, and undertaking a pilgrimage to London to
obtain her pardon, are both represented as true by my fair and
obliging correspondent; and they led me to consider the possibility
of rendering a fictitious personage interesting by mere dignity of
mind and rectitude of principle, assisted by unpretending good
sense and temper, without any of the beauty, grace, talent,
accomplishment, and wit, to which a heroine of romance is supposed
to have a prescriptive right. If the portrait was received with
interest by the public, I am conscious how much it was owing to the
truth and force of the original sketch, which I regret that I am
unable to present to the public, as it was written with much
feeling and spirit.</p>
<p><i>Bride of Lammermoor</i>.&mdash;The terrible catastrophe of
the Bride of Lammermoor actually occurred in a Scottish family of
rank. The female relative, by whom the melancholy tale was
communicated to me many years since, was a near connexion of the
family in which the event happened, and always told it with an
appearance of melancholy mystery, which enhanced the interest. She
had known, in her youth, the brother who rode before the unhappy
victim to the fatal altar, who, though then a mere boy, and
occupied almost entirely with the gallantry of his own appearance
in the bridal procession, could not but remark that the hand of his
sister was moist, and cold as that of a statue. It is unnecessary
further to withdraw the veil from this scene of family distress,
nor, although it occurred more than a hundred years since, might it
be altogether agreeable to the representatives of the families
concerned in the narrative. It may be proper to say that the events
are imitated; but I had neither the means nor intention of copying
the manners, or tracing the characters, of the persons concerned in
the real story.</p>
<p><i>The Antiquary</i>.&mdash;The character of Jonathan Oldbuck,
in the "Antiquary," was partly founded on that of an old friend of
my youth, to whom I am indebted for introducing me to Shakspeare,
and other invaluable favours; but I thought I had so completely
disguised the likeness, that it could not be recognised by any one
now alive. I was mistaken, however, and indeed had endangered what
I desired should be considered as a secret; for I afterwards
learned that a highly respectable gentleman, one of the few
surviving friends of my father, and an acute critic, had said, upon
the appearance of the work, that he was now convinced who was the
author of it, as he recognised, in the "Antiquary," traces of the
character of a very intimate friend of my father's family.</p>
<p><i>Waverley</i>.&mdash;The sort of exchange of gallantry between
the Baron of Bradwardine and Col. Talbot is a literal fact. [For
the real circumstances of the anecdote, we must refer our readers
to the "Introduction" itself. It was communicated to Sir Walter by
the late Lord Kinedder.]</p>
<p><i>Guy Mannering</i>.&mdash;The origin of Meg Merrilies, and of
one or two other personages of the same cast of character, will be
found in a review of the <i>Tales of my Landlord</i> in the
<i>Quarterly Review</i> of January, 1817.</p>
<p><i>Legend of Montrose</i>.&mdash;The tragic and savage
circumstances which are represented as preceding the birth of Allan
Mac Aulay, in the "Legend of Montrose," really happened in the
family of Stewart of Ardvoirloch. The wager about the candlesticks,
whose place was supplied by Highland torch-bearers, was laid and
won by one of the Mac Donalds of Keppoch.</p>
<hr />
<p>I may, however, before dismissing the subject, allude to the
various localities which have been affixed to some of the, scenery
introduced into these novels, by which, for example, Wolf's-Hope is
identified with Fast Castle, in Berwickshire; Tillietudlem with
Draphane, in Clydesdale; and the valley in the "Monastery," called
Glendearg, with the dale of the <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page343" name="page343"></a>[pg 343]</span> Allan, above Lord
Somerville's villa, near Melrose. I can only say, that, in these
and other instances, I had no purpose of describing any particular
local spot; and the resemblance must therefore be of that general
kind which necessarily exists betwixt scenes of the same character.
The iron-bound coast of Scotland affords upon its headlands and
promontories fifty such castles as Wolf's-Hope; every country has a
valley more or less resembling Glendearg; and if castles like
Tillietudlem. or mansions like the Baron of Bradwardine's, are now
less frequently to be met with, it is owing to the rage of
indiscriminate destruction, which has removed or ruined so many
monuments of antiquity, when they were not protected by their
inaccessible situation.&mdash;The scraps of poetry which have been
in most cases tacked to the beginning of chapters in these novels,
are sometimes quoted either from reading or from memory, but, in
the general case, are pure invention. I found it too troublesome to
turn to the collection of the British poets to discover apposite
mottos, and, in the situation of the theatrical mechanist, who,
when the white paper which represented his shower of snow was
exhausted, continued the storm by snowing brown, I drew on my
memory as long as I could, and when that failed, eked it out with
invention. I believe that, in some cases, where actual names are
affixed to the supposed quotations, it would be to little purpose
to seek them in the works, of the authors referred to.&mdash;And
now the reader may expect me, while in the confessional, to explain
the motives why I have so long persisted in disclaiming the works
of which I am now writing. To this it would be difficult to give
any other reply, save that of Corporal Nym&mdash;It was the humour
or caprice of the time.</p>
<p>It was not until I had attained the age, of thirty years that I
made any serious attempt at distinguishing myself as an author; and
at that period, men's hopes, desires, and wishes, have usually
acquired something of a decisive character, and are not eagerly and
easily diverted into a new channel. When I made the
discovery,&mdash;for to me it was one,&mdash;that by amusing myself
with composition, which I felt a delightful occupation, I could
also give pleasure to others, and became aware that literary
pursuits were likely to engage in future a considerable portion of
my time, I felt some alarm that I might acquire those habits of
jealousy and fretfulness which have lessened, and even degraded,
the character of the children of imagination, and rendered them, by
petty squabbles and mutual irritability, the laughing-stock of the
people of the world, I resolved, therefore, in this respect, to
guard my breast (perhaps an unfriendly critic may add, my brow,)
with triple brass, and as much as possible to avoid resting my
thoughts and wishes upon literary success, lest I should endanger
my own peace of mind and tranquillity by literary failure. It would
argue either stupid apathy or ridiculous affectation, to say that I
have been insensible to the public applause, when I have been
honoured with its testimonies; and still more highly do I prize the
invaluable friendships which some temporary popularity has enabled
me to form among those most distinguished by talents and genius,
and which I venture to hope now rest upon a basis more firm than
the circumstances which gave rise to them. Yet feeling all these
advantages, as a man ought to do, and must do, I may say, with
truth and confidence, that I have tasted of the intoxicating cup
with moderation, and that I have never, either in conversation or
correspondence, encouraged discussions respecting my own literary
pursuits. On the contrary, I have usually found such topics, even
when introduced from motives most flattering to myself, rather
embarrassing and disagreeable. I have now frankly told my motives
for concealment, so far as I am conscious of having any, and the
public will forgive the egotism of the detail, as what is
necessarily connected with it. I have only to repeat, that I avow
myself in print, as formerly in words, the sole and unassisted
author of all the novels published as the composition of the
"Author of Waverley." I ought to mention, before concluding, that
twenty persons at least were, either from intimacy or from the
confidence which circumstances rendered necessary, participant of
this secret; and as there was no instance, to my knowledge, of any
one of the number breaking the confidence required from them, I am
the more obliged to them, because the slight and trivial character
of the mystery was not qualified to inspire much respect in those
intrusted with it.</p>

<h3>"SPIRITS" OF THE MAGAZINES.</h3>
<p>Is it not diverting to see a periodical supported, not by the
spirits of the age, but by the small beers, with now and then a few
ales and porters? Yet we doubt not that one and all of the people
employed about the concern may be, in their way, very respectable
schoolmasters, who, in small villages, cannot support themselves
entirely on their own bottoms,&mdash;ushers in metropolitan
academies, whose annual salary rarely exceeds twenty pounds, with
some board, and a little washing&mdash;third-rate actors on the

turn&mdash;a player on the hautboy in some orchestra or

<hr />
<h3>FRAMEWORK OF SOCIETY.</h3>
<p>"It is curious," says the <i>London Magazine</i>, "to imagine
what the society of <i>New South Wales</i> may be two thousand
years hence. The ancestors of a portion of our proud nobility were
thieves of one kind, the chieftain of ruder times being often
nothing better than a well-established robber. And why may not the
descendants of another kind of thieves glory equally in their
origin at some distant day, and proudly trace themselves to a
Soames and a Filch, and dwell with romantic glow, on their
larcenous deeds? A descendant of Soames may have as much pride in
recalling the deeds of that distinguished felon in the Strand, as a
descendant of a border chief has in recounting his ancestors levies

<h3>SEEING IS BELIEVING.</h3>
<p>In South America, the whole population is equestrian. No man
goes to visit his next door neighbour on foot; and even the beggars
in the street ask alms on horseback. A French traveller being
solicited for charity by one of these mounted petitioners, at
Buenos Ayres, makes the following entry in his
note-book.&mdash;"16th November. Saw a beggar this morning, who
asked alms of me, mounted on a tall grey horse. The English have a
proverb, that says&mdash;'Set a beggar on horseback, and he'll ride
to the devil!' I had often heard this mentioned, but never saw one
upon his way before."</p>

<p>We remember to have seen in Paris a man in a sort of chaise,
grinding an organ, drawn by two ponies, and followed by a
boy&mdash;begging from house to house. From the faded <i>livery</i>
worn by the boy, we set the whole down as a burlesque.</p>
<hr />
<h3>SHADOW CATCHER.</h3>
<p>I was present, some years ago, at the trial of a notorious
obeah-man, driven on an estate in the parish of St. David, who, by
the overwhelming influence he had acquired over the minds of his
deluded victims, and the more potent means he had at command to
accomplish his ends, had done great injury among the slaves on the
property before it was discovered. One of the witnesses, a negro
belonging to the same estate, was asked&mdash;"Do you know the
prisoner to be an obeah-man?"&mdash;"Ees, massa, shadow-catcher,
true." "What do you mean by a shadow-catcher?"&mdash;"Him ha
coffin, (a little coffin produced,) him set for catch dem shadow."
"What shadow do you mean?"&mdash;"When him set obeah for summary,
(some body,) him catch dem shadow and dem go dead;" and too surely
they were soon dead, when he pretended to have caught their
shadows, by whatever means it was effected.</p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
